Welcome to my very first Power BI project! This Netflix Content Analysis Dashboard is designed to provide insights into the vast array of content available on Netflix, using Power BI for visualization and analysis.

Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing Netflix's content from various perspectives, including:

Top Genres: Identification of the most popular genres on Netflix.
Content Length Analysis: Detailed breakdown of content by duration, including the percentage of short films, long movies, and TV shows.
Yearly Growth: Visualization of the growth trends in Netflix's movie and show catalog over the years.

Average Duration: Comparison of the average length of movies vs. shows.
Movies vs. Shows Percentage: Analysis of the distribution of movies and TV shows on Netflix.
Why This Project?
As my first project in Power BI, this dashboard marks the beginning of my journey into data visualization. With the ever-growing content library on streaming platforms like Netflix, it's essential to understand the trends, preferences, and growth patterns. This dashboard helps to identify these trends through clear and actionable visualizations.

Technologies Used:
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
DAX: Used for custom calculations and data manipulation.

Future Enhancements:
Incorporating user reviews and ratings for more granular analysis.
Adding interactive filters for deeper insights.
